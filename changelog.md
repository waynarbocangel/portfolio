I changed the formats from the images to webp and added a script to check uploaded images in the project creation process to be small. These two took my site from a performance score of 78 to 100 as seen in the lighthouseBefore.jpg and lighthouseAfter.jpg. At the same time I addressed some blocking resources that could be deffered to improve load times. I also used more semantic code within components throughout development and fixed some confusing layout issues for accessibility. This boosted my accessibility score up as well. Some other improvements like reducing use of divs might help get it even better in the near future.

I also changed the design of some sections of the site like making my project cards smaller to encourage users to expand the blog posts. In addition to this the login page and console work extremely well at managing the content and offer a cohesive design pattern with the rest of the application.
